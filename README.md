# What is it?
This is my project where I try to make a cheap toy car model more smarter and fun. This project based on a Raspberry Pi Zero computer which is implanted in the toy car. This device has a Wi-Fi module and I use this way to control a car. I have implemented a server app which receives signals by WebSocket with control values (steering and drive). I had to change the original driver from the car by a servo driver. Now I have implemented a smooth steering feature and a smooth drive feature. Additionally, I have implemented a video streaming feature, but It totally based on [this project](https://github.com/131/h264-live-player).

Feel free to contact me if you have some questions.
